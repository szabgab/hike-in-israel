On this occassion I could not find the way down so I had to return. I can go back and try to walk the longer route
(after ascending on the red line go on the green even when it starts to go inland and then switch to the blue
and another red and then back on the yellow/black and then return on the road on the seaside. It is almost 22 km.
If someone can pick me up on road 90 it can be shorter ~ 16km, If going to Neve Zohar (and then by car) then
it is only 13 km.

## Metzukei Dragot (Dead Sea)

## Mt. Hermon - Neve Ativ

The last part of the descend was nuts, we should have followed the route. So next time when I do this I'll have to that part more carefully.
This was a super exhausting hike, but one that I enjoyed a lot.
