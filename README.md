I would like to do part of the Israel trail if anyone is interested.

I have a phobia of dogs. Is there an option to have hikes that are for humans only?
I would love to bring my dog :)

We don't organize car pooling but we'd like to see you self-organize for that.
We would like to encourage every participant who comes by car and can offer a ride to post a comment telling us where she/he is coming from. We would also like to encourage guests to post if they need a ride. Meetup allows personal messages via the site. You can get in touch with the others who posted and arrange for the ride.
